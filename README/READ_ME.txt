This project is made for the VR Oculus Quest2. 
You won't be able to check the running project now. However I captured some images for better understanding. 


February Week 4

1. I worked on fixing the deprecated files to match the current Unity version.

2. QuestionManager is the script file I worked on this week.
If a player collides with another player inside a multiplayer environment, a Question window pops up and a timer starts counting time. There is a list of questions saved inside a game, and every time the players collide, a new question and audio file are shown on the screen. 

3. Right now there is an issue to be solved for Photon server system. I to work on the order of the players join the server and deal with the exception when a player joins and exit the server several times.
